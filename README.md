Chexers
Chexers is a three-player hexagonal turn-based race game. Test the loyalty of your band of two faced checker pieces as you charge them through a twisting and treacherous battleground. Will all your pieces stay true to your cause? Can you earn yourself some new followers in the chaos? To win this tumultuous chase, you must double-cross and triple-cross your way across the finish line before your opponents--three, two, one... go!
